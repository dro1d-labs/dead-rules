# De-Ad Blocking Rules

Open, auditable content blocking rules used by **[De-Ad](https://dro1d.org/dead.html)** — a minimal Safari ad blocker for iOS.

## Philosophy
- 🔒 100% offline, on-device processing
- 👁️ No tracking, telemetry, or analytics
- 🚫 No remote rule execution
- 📂 Fully auditable and transparent
- 🆓 Free forever (app has optional Pro themes)

## How It Works
De-Ad provides Safari with a curated blocklist (`blockerList.json`) that:
1. Safari's WebKit engine compiles into optimized rules
2. Blocks ads, trackers, and analytics **before** they load
3. Runs entirely on your device
4. Never sees your browsing history (by design of Apple's Content Blocker API)

## What's Included
- ✅ Curated third-party blocklists (see [RULES.md](RULES.md))
- ✅ dro1d labs custom optimizations
- ✅ Cookie banner & consent popup rules
- ✅ Social media tracker rules
- ✅ All rules in human-readable JSON format

## What's NOT Included
- ❌ App source code (app is proprietary, rules are open)
- ❌ User data (we don't collect any)
- ❌ Telemetry or analytics
- ❌ Remote update infrastructure

## File Structure

## Using These Rules
These rules are automatically bundled with the **De-Ad iOS app**. They update when you update the app from the App Store.

**Want to use them elsewhere?**  
The rules are Safari Content Blocker format. You can use them in any compatible iOS/macOS app, but De-Ad is built specifically for these rules.

## Transparency Promise
Every domain blocked by De-Ad is visible in `blockerList.json`.  
No hidden rules. No secret exceptions. No paid whitelists.
