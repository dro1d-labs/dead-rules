# De-Ad Blocking Rules

Open, auditable content blocking rules used by **[De-Ad](https://dro1d.org/dead.html)** — a minimal, anti-surveillance Safari ad blocker for iOS.

## Philosophy

**De-Ad blocks ads without ever looking at what you browse.**

Most ad blockers inspect the active page to apply complex cosmetic fixes. De-Ad refuses to do this.
- **No Safari App Extension:** We do not have permission to read your URL or page content.
- **No Automatic Reloads:** We do not perform background actions.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** If a site breaks, *you* decide to whitelist it using our manual tools. The app never makes decisions for you.

## How It Works
De-Ad provides Safari with a curated blocklist (`blockerList.json`) generated by our proprietary engine.
1. Safari's WebKit engine compiles these rules into bytecode.
2. Ads and trackers are blocked at the network level **before** they load.
3. Whitelisted domains are injected via local App Groups on your device, keeping the main blocklist intact.

## What's Included
- ✅ **40,000 Precision Rules:** Optimized to prevent Safari memory crashes.
- ✅ **Smart Consolidation:** Blocks ad networks (e.g., `doubleclick.net`) while protecting content hosts.
- ✅ **Curated Sources:** Aggregates Peter Lowe, AdAway, and EasyList (see [RULES.md](RULES.md)).
- ✅ **100% Offline:** No telemetry, no "cloud" lookups.

## What's NOT Included
- ❌ App source code (app is proprietary, rules are open)
- ❌ User data collection
- ❌ "Acceptable Ads" (we don't take money to let ads through)
- ❌ Remote execution
